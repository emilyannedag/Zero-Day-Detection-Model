A novel approach to enhance traditional vulnerability scanning tools by predicting hidden relationships between CVE vulnerabilities with Neural Networks.

---

## 🎯 Project Overview

Zero-day vulnerabilities represent one of cybersecurity's most critical threats. This research addresses the limitations of traditional point-in-time vulnerability scanners by developing an AI-powered system that can:

- **Detect undetectable vulnerabilities** that may be overlooked or introduced between scans
- **Predict CVE co-occurrences** using neural network analysis
- **Reduce response time** to potential zero-day attacks

## 🔬 Research Question

*How can the use of Neural Networks improve the efficacy of contemporary vulnerability scanning tools by identifying co-occurrences between vulnerabilities?*

## 🚀 Key Features

- 🧠 **TensorFlow Neural Network** trained on vulnerability reports
- 🔍 **CVE Relationship Detection** through co-occurrence analysis
- ⚡ **Predictive Vulnerability Assessment** beyond traditional scanning
- 📈 **Performance Evaluation** using artificially omitted vulnerabilities

## 🛠️ Technical Stack

- **Machine Learning**: TensorFlow 2.x with Keras
- **Development Environment**: Google Colab (T4 GPU)
- **Programming Language**: Python
- **Data Source**: Shodan.io

## 🔬 Methodology

1. **Dataset Collection**: Structured vulnerability data mapping CVE relationships
2. **Neural Network Development**: Custom TensorFlow model for pattern recognition
4. **Training & Testing**: Evaluation using omitted CVE simulation

## 📈 Evaluation Approach

The model's performance is measured by its ability to predict deliberately omitted CVEs from unseen vulnerability reports, simulating real-world zero-day detection scenarios.

## 🎓 Academic Context

This research builds upon existing work in:
- Graph Neural Networks for cybersecurity
- Zero-day attack prediction using AI
- Vulnerability relationship analysis

## 📅 Project Timeline

**Duration**: 13 weeks (June - September 2024)
- **Weeks 1-4**: Literature review and research planning
- **Weeks 5-7**: Algorithm development and neural network training
- **Weeks 8-9**: Mid-period presentation
- **Weeks 10-13**: Testing, fine-tuning, and thesis completion

## 🎯 Expected Impact

This research aims to contribute to cybersecurity by:
- Enhancing predictive vulnerability detection capabilities
- Reducing blind spots in traditional vulnerability scanning
- Providing a proactive approach to zero-day threat mitigation
- Strengthening overall system resilience
